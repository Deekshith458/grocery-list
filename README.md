# Grocery List
Integrating Airtable API with Vercel serverless functions

## Getting started 🚀

1. Download it, `git clone` into coding environment of your choice 😃, or use the import from Github on [replit.com](https://replit.com) (or codesandbox, Glitch, etc).
2. Install dependencies: 🔽 `npm install`.
3. Run the development server: 👨‍💻 `npm run dev`.

## Deploy with Vercel

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

I recommend using Vercel for deployment. It requires no configuration, is totally free for personal projects, and supports all the features of Next.js with the best performance.
